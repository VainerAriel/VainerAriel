Hi there! I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo with a passion for data science, game development, and math. I'm experienced with Flask, ASP.NET, and React, and proficient in Python, C, C#, JavaScript, and TypeScript. I'm also familiar with tools like Auth0 and MongoDB, and always eager to learn and take on new challenges.

In my free time, I explore new technologies and build personal projects to sharpen my skills. My GitHub features everything from simple scripts to full applications. I'm always open to feedback, so feel free to reach out with thoughts or ideas!
