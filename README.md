Hi there! I am a student in my first year of undergrad with a strong passion for Computer Science and Math. I have experience coding in Python, JavaScript, Processing (Java), and C, and am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new programming concepts and working on personal projects to further develop my skills. On my GitHub profile, you'll find a collection of my programming projects, ranging from simple scripts to more complex applications. I am always open to feedback and suggestions, so don't hesitate to reach out if you have any thoughts or ideas. Thank you for visiting my profile!

You can reach me by the email arielvainer.main@gmail.com, or by my school email avainer@uwaterloo.ca.
