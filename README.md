Hi there! I am a student entering first year of undergrad with a strong passion for computer science and math. I have experience coding in Processing, Python, and JavaScript, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new programming languages and working on personal projects to further develop my skills. On my GitHub profile, you'll find a collection of my programming projects, ranging from simple scripts to more complex applications. I am always open to feedback and suggestions, so don't hesitate to reach out if you have any thoughts or ideas. Thank you for visiting my profile!

You can reach me by the mail arielvainer.main@gmail.com

For all my game jam projects go to my [itch.io page](arielvainer.itch.io)
